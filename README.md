# Deep Reinforcement Learning vs Deep Learning <br> Retail Recommendation Engines <img width=90 align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Duke_University_logo.svg/1024px-Duke_University_logo.svg.png">

## Introduction
Recommendation engines are present in every aspect of our digital lifes today. The retail industry in particular heavily depends on efficient algorithms to push the products to relevant customers.
In this project, we implement and benchmark the performance of two Deep Reinforcement Learning models and one Deep Learning model on two separate datasets in order to better understand the nuances of each system.

### Deep Reinforcement Models
#### *Supervised Negative Q-learning (SNQN)*
Sequential transactional data can be leveraged to recommend relevant products with reinforcement learning algorithms. One limitation to this vanilla approach is the lack of negative reward signals. Xin Xin, et al. proposed the SNQN method to address this positive signal bias by using negative action items 

#### *Supervised Advantage Actor-Critic (SA2C)*

#### Bayesian
